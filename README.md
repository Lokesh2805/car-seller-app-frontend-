I had create a car seller/rental app(frontend), here I had used ReactJS, Material UI and Redux.
React JS and material UI is used to create the attractive looks of website with responsive behaviour and they are also used to add pagination feature.
Redux is used to add the search functionality where user can search for a particular from the data available of cars.
Here are some screenshots of how website looks:
